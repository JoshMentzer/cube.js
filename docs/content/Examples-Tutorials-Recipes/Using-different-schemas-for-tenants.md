## Use case

We want to manage user access to different Cubes. In the
recipe below, we'll learn how to use multiple data schemas for various tenants.

## Configuration

We have two tenants and we created folders with the data schema for each one inside the `schema` folder. The folders are named such as a tenants. Then we have to tell Cube which data schema path to use for each tenant. We'll use the [`repositoryFactory`](https://cube.dev/docs/config#repository-factory) option to do it. We'll pass the tenant name into the `repositoryFactory` inside [`securityContext`](https://cube.dev/docs/security/context#top). We also should define the [`contextToAppId`](https://cube.dev/docs/config#context-to-app-id) property for caching schema compilation result.
Our cube.js file we'll look like this:

```javascript
const FileRepository = require('@cubejs-backend/server-core/core/FileRepository');

module.exports = {
  contextToAppId: ({ securityContext }) =>
    `CUBEJS_APP_${securityContext.tenant}`,

  repositoryFactory: ({ securityContext }) =>
    new FileRepository(`schema/${securityContext.tenant}`),
};
```

## Data schema

In our case we'll get products with odd `id` values for Avocado tenant and with even `id` values for Mango tenant:

```javascript
// schema/avocado
cube(`Products`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.Products WHERE MOD (id, 2) = 1`,
  
  ...
});

// schema/mango
cube(`Products`, {
  sql: `SELECT * FROM public.Products WHERE MOD (id, 2) = 0`,
  
  ...
});
```

## Query

To get the products, we will send two identical queries with different JWTs:

```javascript
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "tenant": "Avocado",
  "iat": 1000000000,
  "exp": 5000000000
}
```

```javascript
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "tenant": "Mango",
  "iat": 1000000000,
  "exp": 5000000000
}
```

## Result

We have received different data from schemas corresponding to various tenants and located in different folders:

```javascript
// Avocado products
[
  {
    "Products.id": 1,
    "Products.name": "Generic Fresh Keyboard"
  },
  {
    "Products.id": 3,
    "Products.name": "Practical Wooden Keyboard"
  },
  {
    "Products.id": 5,
    "Products.name": "Handcrafted Rubber Chicken"
  }
]
```

```javascript
// Mango products:
[
  {
    "Products.id": 2,
    "Products.name": "Gorgeous Cotton Sausages"
  },
  {
    "Products.id": 4,
    "Products.name": "Handmade Wooden Soap"
  },
  {
    "Products.id": 6,
    "Products.name": "Handcrafted Plastic Chair"
  }
]
```

or run it with the `docker-compose up` command. You'll see the result, including
queried data, in the console.
